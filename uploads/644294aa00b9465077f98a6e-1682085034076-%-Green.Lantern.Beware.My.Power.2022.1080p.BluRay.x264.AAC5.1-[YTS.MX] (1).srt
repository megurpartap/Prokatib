1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:03,814
Jimbo, I need targets!

3
00:01:07,902 --> 00:01:08,902
Shit.

4
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:28,130
Hey! Move it, buddy.
You're blocking the door.

5
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,514
Sorry. Reflex.

6
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:39,392
What the hell's wrong with you?

7
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:41,602
Have a nice day.

8
00:01:53,698 --> 00:01:55,491
Get off me! You have to run!

9
00:01:55,992 --> 00:01:58,995
The world will end in a flash
of light and you'll be gone!

10
00:01:59,704 --> 00:02:02,123
You'll all be gone,
just like the others!

11
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:06,002
We told you to leave this alley!

12
00:02:08,671 --> 00:02:10,965
And now, you pay the price.

13
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:24,687
Stop!

14
00:02:25,563 --> 00:02:27,815
You want to play bodyguard
for this garbage?

15
00:02:37,116 --> 00:02:38,409
I guess I do.

16
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:44,040
Then you're a dead man, too!

17
00:02:44,582 --> 00:02:47,209
We're all dead! Everyone's dead!

18
00:02:47,293 --> 00:02:48,919
Dead, dead, dead...

19
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,706
Police! Freeze!

20
00:03:36,384 --> 00:03:38,886
You can't just go beating the
crap out of people, soldier.

21
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:43,474
We got a public disturbance.

22
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:45,351
Name's Stewart, John.

23
00:03:45,434 --> 00:03:47,162
- Looks like he might be a vet...
- Where'd you do your tour?

24
00:03:47,186 --> 00:03:48,312
Afghanistan?

25
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:51,899
I was in Iraq. That sucked, too.

26
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:56,570
Mike, come here...

27
00:03:59,031 --> 00:04:00,908
You're not going
to believe this,

28
00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:03,077
but this guy's a
Medal of Honor winner.

29
00:04:03,661 --> 00:04:05,413
Citation list a mile long.

30
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:09,417
Do we really want to risk getting
heat from social media or the press?

31
00:04:12,086 --> 00:04:13,504
Go home, Mr. Stewart.

32
00:04:14,296 --> 00:04:15,464
Stay out of trouble.

33
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:51,375
At last. There you are.

34
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:24,909
What the hell?

35
00:06:10,663 --> 00:06:15,543
I found you at
last, John Stewart.

36
00:06:19,213 --> 00:06:21,131
Who are you? How do you know me?

37
00:06:24,385 --> 00:06:27,471
You must... You must...

38
00:06:27,555 --> 00:06:30,057
Lay still. I'm gonna
take you to the hospital.

39
00:07:01,213 --> 00:07:02,673
Poor bastard.

40
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,685
<i>John Stewart of Earth!</i>

41
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:18,522
Who? What?

42
00:07:19,315 --> 00:07:21,275
<i>You possess singular will.</i>

43
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:23,652
<i>Welcome to the
Green Lantern Corps.</i>

44
00:07:40,336 --> 00:07:42,421
Get off of me!

45
00:07:45,633 --> 00:07:47,217
And what the hell is this now?

46
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,471
<i>That is your Green
Lantern Corps uniform,</i>

47
00:07:50,554 --> 00:07:52,056
<i>Green Lantern John Stewart.</i>

48
00:07:52,556 --> 00:07:54,099
<i>Alterations can be made.</i>

49
00:07:54,183 --> 00:07:57,186
No, no, no... I am
not hearing this!

50
00:07:57,269 --> 00:07:58,646
<i>Green Lantern John Stewart...</i>

51
00:07:58,729 --> 00:08:00,105
Stop calling me that!

52
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:02,566
Okay, great! Now
I'm talking to it!

53
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:05,986
<i>Contacting Green Lantern
headquarters on Oa for guidance.</i>

54
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:08,489
Right. You do that,
and I'll do this.

55
00:08:09,657 --> 00:08:11,200
<i>Contact unsuccessful.</i>

56
00:08:11,659 --> 00:08:14,745
<i>You are tasked with halting
five genocides in this sector.</i>

57
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:17,331
<i>Then you must stop
the Baelishian War...</i>

58
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:18,874
Pound sand, ring!

59
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:35,432
I'm taking all the damn meds
the VA prescribes from now on.

60
00:08:35,933 --> 00:08:38,769
And you are getting
off my finger!

61
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:40,854
Dammit! Why won't you come off?

62
00:08:40,938 --> 00:08:43,941
<i>Standard ring
programming superseded.</i>

63
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:46,193
Okay. Okay, okay.
Let's just calm down.

64
00:08:47,611 --> 00:08:50,614
Is there someone who would know
what to do in this situation?

65
00:08:51,115 --> 00:08:52,241
Someone I can talk to?

66
00:08:52,324 --> 00:08:53,242
<i>Affirmative.</i>

67
00:08:53,325 --> 00:08:54,743
Can you show them to me?

68
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:07,548
Stop! Stop!

69
00:09:08,716 --> 00:09:09,716
You're gonna kill me!

70
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:13,554
<i>Are you addressing me,
Green Lantern John Stewart?</i>

71
00:09:13,971 --> 00:09:16,223
Who the hell else
would I be talking to?

72
00:09:16,974 --> 00:09:18,600
<i>To avoid future confusion,</i>

73
00:09:19,393 --> 00:09:22,646
<i>consider addressing
me as "Ring."</i>

74
00:09:29,361 --> 00:09:30,571
What's that up ahead?

75
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:34,992
I mean... Ring, what
is that up ahead?

76
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:38,746
<i>It is called the Justice
League Watchtower.</i>

77
00:10:04,313 --> 00:10:06,190
All right guys, I have no idea

78
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:08,484
what's going on out in
galactic sector 814,

79
00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:11,445
but it is definitely big and
the disruption is spreading.

80
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:12,863
It could even reach Earth.

81
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,702
We need all hands on deck.

82
00:10:18,786 --> 00:10:22,206
Superman and Wonder Woman
should be back within a week.

83
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:24,625
Perhaps they will
have answers for us.

84
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:26,989
It's too bad Batman's pulled
one of his disappearing acts.

85
00:10:27,795 --> 00:10:29,713
We're stretched
too thin as it is.

86
00:10:41,225 --> 00:10:42,225
Hey.

87
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:44,143
Intruder!

88
00:10:44,937 --> 00:10:46,063
Alpha Defense Pattern!

89
00:10:49,733 --> 00:10:50,818
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

90
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:54,153
Back off!

91
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,211
I have pointy ones, too.

92
00:11:51,295 --> 00:11:53,380
Green Arrow, wait... look.

93
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:58,635
Are you a Green Lantern?

94
00:11:58,719 --> 00:12:01,221
That would explain why he
didn't set off any alarms.

95
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:03,473
I'm not here to fight.

96
00:12:03,557 --> 00:12:05,601
I just want to get
rid of this thing.

97
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,563
It is a Lantern Power Ring.

98
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:12,649
The Guardians didn't say anything
about sending a new Green Lantern.

99
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:15,819
Well, the Guardians haven't
said squat to us in like a year.

100
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:19,615
Power Ring, who was
your previous owner?

101
00:12:20,991 --> 00:12:22,910
<i>Green Lantern Hal Jordan.</i>

102
00:12:24,536 --> 00:12:26,747
Hal Jordan... is dead?

103
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:28,790
Who are you? How did you
get our friend's ring?

104
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:33,003
My name is John Stewart

105
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:35,589
and if I told you, you
wouldn't believe me.

106
00:12:41,053 --> 00:12:43,597
Try us. We are the
Justice League.

107
00:12:44,932 --> 00:12:46,475
We have seen a lot.

108
00:12:46,558 --> 00:12:47,559
Seriously.

109
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:49,394
A lot.

110
00:12:51,563 --> 00:12:53,398
A burning space
ship crashed by me.

111
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:55,609
I ran over to help and found,

112
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:57,611
swear to God, a
little blue alien.

113
00:12:57,694 --> 00:12:59,947
And, he turned to dust.

114
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:03,200
Then this talking
ring flew on my finger

115
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:04,743
and now it won't come off.

116
00:13:13,043 --> 00:13:15,045
Why would a Guardian
come to Earth

117
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:16,630
to deliver a Power Ring?

118
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:18,715
He's lying, that's
why. Hal's not dead.

119
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:20,509
This guy is trying to trick us.

120
00:13:20,968 --> 00:13:22,970
Power Rings are
like my Tantu Totem.

121
00:13:23,053 --> 00:13:26,181
They're not easily wielded
by someone unworthy.

122
00:13:26,264 --> 00:13:29,101
Okay did you see how much
he sucked at using it?

123
00:13:31,186 --> 00:13:34,481
Perhaps this is connected to
those disturbances in deep space.

124
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:36,900
Maybe we should go find out
what's going on out there.

125
00:13:36,984 --> 00:13:38,986
We cannot leave
Earth unprotected.

126
00:13:39,069 --> 00:13:41,238
And since the Flash
is also on a mission,

127
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:45,325
I am the only one qualified to
administrate the Watchtower.

128
00:13:45,409 --> 00:13:48,328
I'll go. I got to get to the
truth of what happened to Hal.

129
00:13:48,412 --> 00:13:50,247
You should take him with you.

130
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,665
No way. Hard pass.

131
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:54,126
Hard, hard pass. I don't
trust this guy one bit.

132
00:13:54,209 --> 00:13:55,836
He seems totally sketchy.

133
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:58,463
You do realize I
can hear you, right?

134
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:01,026
Look, I'll check out
the crashed ship.

135
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:03,343
If it still flies,
I'll autopilot to Oa.

136
00:14:03,427 --> 00:14:04,947
I'll get right in
the Guardians faces.

137
00:14:06,638 --> 00:14:08,181
I'm sure they'll love that.

138
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:11,435
And if something has happened
to Hal, then we'll know.

139
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:13,270
But he stays here.

140
00:14:13,979 --> 00:14:17,607
Uh, question, can any of
you get this ring off me?

141
00:14:19,276 --> 00:14:22,195
I have witnessed Green
Lanterns take their rings off,

142
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:25,240
so it should be
possible, unless...

143
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:28,076
The ring's programming
was changed?

144
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,160
Yes.

145
00:14:29,745 --> 00:14:31,872
But these Guardians,
they could get it off?

146
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:34,541
They did create the Power Rings.

147
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:41,631
Then I'm going to this
"Oa" place with you.

148
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:43,800
You got a problem with
that, talk to the hand.

149
00:14:45,469 --> 00:14:47,387
You know, the one
with the ring on it.

150
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:01,068
Hey! Watch it! Slow down!

151
00:15:04,946 --> 00:15:07,824
Terrible. On, like, all fronts.

152
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,329
This was a burning
wreck when I left it.

153
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:14,581
Now, it's like new.

154
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:19,294
Mm, yeah, it probably has some kind
of sophisticated self-repair program,

155
00:15:19,377 --> 00:15:20,754
like nanites and what have you.

156
00:15:27,344 --> 00:15:29,096
You seem to know
your way around.

157
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:31,657
Actually, I've never seen it
before. But Hal once explained to me

158
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:34,184
that the real measure of
any advanced technology

159
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:36,103
is how intuitive it is to use.

160
00:15:46,321 --> 00:15:48,031
You think you can
fly this thing to Oa?

161
00:15:48,115 --> 00:15:50,033
I... am not sure. Probably.

162
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:53,869
But...

163
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:55,621
But what?

164
00:15:57,207 --> 00:15:58,333
We need coordinates.

165
00:16:02,754 --> 00:16:03,754
Talk to your Ring.

166
00:16:04,047 --> 00:16:05,173
What do you mean?

167
00:16:05,507 --> 00:16:07,300
Well, just ask it
for directions to Oa.

168
00:16:07,384 --> 00:16:08,528
In fact, just tell
it to put them

169
00:16:08,552 --> 00:16:10,345
into the ship's autopilot
and get us moving.

170
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:14,766
Ring, did you hear all
that? Can you do it?

171
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:16,852
<i>Unlocking systems.</i>

172
00:16:16,935 --> 00:16:18,019
<i>Integrating.</i>

173
00:16:18,395 --> 00:16:19,729
<i>Coordinates set.</i>

174
00:16:25,152 --> 00:16:27,404
Um, let's go?

175
00:16:47,007 --> 00:16:49,426
<i>The Guardians were among
the first intelligent</i>

176
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:51,219
<i>forms of life in the universe.</i>

177
00:16:51,303 --> 00:16:54,014
<i>When they perceived that
less evolved life forms</i>

178
00:16:54,097 --> 00:16:56,516
<i>were often prone to
chaos and violence,</i>

179
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:00,520
<i>they decided a police force
was necessary to keep order.</i>

180
00:17:01,271 --> 00:17:04,024
<i>These they called
Green Lanterns,</i>

181
00:17:05,108 --> 00:17:06,693
<i>and their members were selected</i>

182
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:09,321
<i>amongst the alien races
for their intelligence,</i>

183
00:17:10,405 --> 00:17:11,405
<i>willpower</i>

184
00:17:12,324 --> 00:17:13,533
<i>and fearlessness.</i>

185
00:17:15,327 --> 00:17:16,328
Huh?

186
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:23,126
Hey, look alive,
rookie. We're here.

187
00:17:26,129 --> 00:17:30,550
So the Guardians are a prickly
bunch that don't much like humans.

188
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:34,512
- Because they've met you?
- That's good, but no.

189
00:17:34,596 --> 00:17:36,723
Because, they think we're
too stupid to waste time on.

190
00:17:36,806 --> 00:17:38,475
Please, don't prove them right.

191
00:17:57,327 --> 00:18:00,580
Okay, so this is why they
haven't returned our calls.

192
00:18:42,372 --> 00:18:43,372
You okay?

193
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:46,208
Yeah.

194
00:18:48,962 --> 00:18:51,214
Everything here is built
around that building,

195
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,302
like it's important
or something.

196
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:59,055
Maybe we'll find
some answers there.

197
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:03,560
Good. Nice to see
you're not useless.

198
00:19:16,156 --> 00:19:17,574
I know this one.

199
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:18,657
Sinestro.

200
00:19:19,117 --> 00:19:21,828
He trained Hal into becoming
the greatest Green Lantern ever.

201
00:19:23,538 --> 00:19:24,581
What happened to him?

202
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:26,416
He turned into an evil psycho.

203
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:29,711
I'm guessing they left that part
out when they gave the tour.

204
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:32,172
But, again, he trained Hal.

205
00:19:34,007 --> 00:19:36,801
Look, it's not like I
haven't heard of Hal Jordan.

206
00:19:36,885 --> 00:19:38,261
And yeah, he's pretty great,

207
00:19:38,345 --> 00:19:41,264
but so were all these
other Lanterns. Right?

208
00:19:44,934 --> 00:19:46,436
Holy crap!

209
00:19:51,775 --> 00:19:53,943
<i>Hal Jordan is acknowledged to be</i>

210
00:19:54,027 --> 00:19:57,113
<i>the greatest Green
Lantern in the universe.</i>

211
00:19:58,782 --> 00:20:00,450
In the universe?

212
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:02,410
Look what I found.

213
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:04,704
Ammo box, huh?

214
00:20:04,788 --> 00:20:07,540
Correct. This is what Lanterns
use to recharge their Rings.

215
00:20:07,624 --> 00:20:08,625
You'll need one.

216
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,129
I'm here to get rid of
this thing, remember?

217
00:20:14,005 --> 00:20:15,298
Better to be prepared.

218
00:20:15,382 --> 00:20:18,385
I'm going to see what else I can
find. Just stay out of trouble, hero.

219
00:20:29,187 --> 00:20:31,481
Well, uh... that's something.

220
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:45,328
Well, all right.

221
00:21:23,575 --> 00:21:25,493
Can't I leave you
alone for one second?

222
00:21:50,977 --> 00:21:53,062
<i>Lethal force is not authorized.</i>

223
00:21:54,981 --> 00:21:56,858
<i>Lethal force is not authorized.</i>

224
00:21:59,194 --> 00:22:01,279
<i>Lethal force is not authorized.</i>

225
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,365
<i>Lethal force is not authorized.</i>

226
00:22:06,618 --> 00:22:07,827
<i>Lethal force is not...</i>

227
00:22:07,911 --> 00:22:08,911
You're killing her!

228
00:22:12,165 --> 00:22:13,458
Stop!

229
00:22:20,882 --> 00:22:23,009
You should have finished me.

230
00:22:24,177 --> 00:22:27,263
Why? We're trying to find
out what happened here.

231
00:22:29,516 --> 00:22:31,935
You weren't part of
the Rannian attack?

232
00:22:32,018 --> 00:22:34,437
Rannians? No no.
We just got here.

233
00:22:34,521 --> 00:22:36,648
I'm Green Arrow. His
name's John Stewart.

234
00:22:37,357 --> 00:22:38,357
Who are you?

235
00:22:39,651 --> 00:22:43,947
I am Shayera Hol, warrior
of Thanagar, First Order.

236
00:22:44,739 --> 00:22:46,908
Okay, well, let's
make a deal, Shayera.

237
00:22:47,033 --> 00:22:49,619
No one kills anyone
for at least a minute

238
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:51,955
and instead we
exchange some info.

239
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:56,084
These are the last images

240
00:22:56,167 --> 00:22:58,545
before the Oan security
net was disabled.

241
00:22:59,379 --> 00:23:00,964
A Rannian ship.

242
00:23:01,047 --> 00:23:03,383
It must have carried
one of their kill squads

243
00:23:03,466 --> 00:23:05,718
instead of the diplomats
listed in the logs.

244
00:23:06,761 --> 00:23:07,761
Maybe.

245
00:23:09,973 --> 00:23:12,058
The evidence is in front of you.

246
00:23:12,141 --> 00:23:14,394
Look, John and I don't
see eye to eye on a lot,

247
00:23:14,477 --> 00:23:17,897
but he's right, we don't
know who was in that ship.

248
00:23:17,981 --> 00:23:19,566
And why are you here?

249
00:23:19,649 --> 00:23:21,734
He's just asking, not accusing.

250
00:23:22,485 --> 00:23:24,654
My ship was destroyed in battle.

251
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:26,864
I came to seek aid
from the Guardians

252
00:23:26,948 --> 00:23:28,992
in our war against the
honor less Rannians

253
00:23:29,075 --> 00:23:30,118
but was too late.

254
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:36,332
They will pay.

255
00:23:38,084 --> 00:23:39,377
If you're seeking vengeance,

256
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,671
shouldn't you be sure you
have the right target?

257
00:23:43,506 --> 00:23:45,508
You don't understand, do you?

258
00:23:51,764 --> 00:23:56,603
<i>After years of bloody war, we
finally achieved the tenuous peace.</i>

259
00:23:58,605 --> 00:23:59,772
<i>To codify it,</i>

260
00:23:59,856 --> 00:24:02,859
<i>Thanagar and Rann agreed
to a joint project</i>

261
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:05,194
<i>led by Sardath and Banth Dar.</i>

262
00:24:06,696 --> 00:24:09,699
<i>Zeta-Beam technology would be
harnessed to create a bridge</i>

263
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:13,202
<i>between our worlds and
boost both of our economies.</i>

264
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:17,832
Banth, begin the
power up sequence!

265
00:24:45,026 --> 00:24:47,487
<i>Initially, the project
was a great success.</i>

266
00:25:08,591 --> 00:25:11,678
Green Lantern to command center.
Are you doing another test?

267
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:43,251
I can't stop the emitter from
firing! We're locked out!

268
00:25:45,962 --> 00:25:48,339
<i>Green Lantern, something
has gone wrong!</i>

269
00:25:48,423 --> 00:25:49,799
What was your first clue?

270
00:25:50,425 --> 00:25:53,052
<i>You must stop the
platform from firing!</i>

271
00:25:54,929 --> 00:25:56,264
I'll try plugging it!

272
00:26:31,758 --> 00:26:34,677
<i>The Zeta force transported
the entire planet of Thanagar</i>

273
00:26:34,761 --> 00:26:39,015
<i>into Rannian space, upsetting
the ecosystem of both planets.</i>

274
00:26:39,766 --> 00:26:43,186
Hal Jordan and millions of
Thanagarians died that day.

275
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:45,688
And the war criminal
Sardath escaped.

276
00:26:46,355 --> 00:26:48,191
How do you know it
wasn't an accident?

277
00:26:48,274 --> 00:26:50,109
And this ship doesn't
prove anything.

278
00:26:51,277 --> 00:26:54,113
A true warrior does
not ask questions.

279
00:26:54,197 --> 00:26:55,865
They do not hesitate.

280
00:26:55,948 --> 00:26:57,200
They kill.

281
00:26:58,868 --> 00:27:01,287
Kinda seems to me we should
talk to the Rannians.

282
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:04,290
The nearest outpost
is light years away.

283
00:27:04,373 --> 00:27:05,458
We have a ship.

284
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:08,503
If you promise not to
attack us, you can come.

285
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:13,966
I shall accompany you
and I will not attack.

286
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:18,554
Unless threatened, insulted,
or menaced. Then, you die.

287
00:27:23,643 --> 00:27:24,894
Well, she's fun.

288
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:38,991
What's this now?

289
00:27:39,075 --> 00:27:41,244
I discovered the Ring
comes with a manual.

290
00:27:41,327 --> 00:27:44,080
This exercise is part of
Green Lantern Corps training.

291
00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:45,164
It's like a video game.

292
00:27:46,666 --> 00:27:49,752
The kind of trouble we're
headed into is not a game.

293
00:27:49,836 --> 00:27:51,921
You said you can get
that Ring off right?

294
00:27:52,004 --> 00:27:54,507
Yeah. Seems I can now.

295
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:56,759
I thought you wanted
to get rid of it?

296
00:27:56,843 --> 00:27:57,844
I do.

297
00:27:57,927 --> 00:28:00,429
But you both need me to make
the ship go to someplace

298
00:28:00,513 --> 00:28:01,793
where there might be shooting...

299
00:28:03,391 --> 00:28:05,101
Well, yeah. I mean probably.

300
00:28:05,852 --> 00:28:08,646
More than likely. Almost
definitely, actually.

301
00:28:09,772 --> 00:28:12,441
So, until we can give this
Ring back to your friend,

302
00:28:12,525 --> 00:28:14,694
it's better to be
prepared, right?

303
00:28:16,988 --> 00:28:18,990
<i>Ring at three percent power.</i>

304
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,120
- Come on. Just when I think I...
- You have to recharge it.

305
00:28:24,787 --> 00:28:25,787
Where's the battery?

306
00:28:34,964 --> 00:28:36,132
Stick your hand in it.

307
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,555
It's not doing anything.

308
00:28:42,638 --> 00:28:43,890
You gotta say the oath.

309
00:28:43,973 --> 00:28:45,808
Oath? What oath?

310
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:48,311
Yeah. Repeat after me...

311
00:28:48,978 --> 00:28:51,147
"In brightest day,
in blackest night,

312
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:52,982
no evil shall escape my sight.

313
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:54,984
Let those who
worship evil's might,

314
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:57,320
beware my power...
Green Lantern's light."

315
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,405
You're kidding, right?

316
00:28:59,488 --> 00:29:02,158
No, I am not. Say it
out loud and proud.

317
00:29:05,328 --> 00:29:07,330
"In brightest day,
in blackest night,

318
00:29:07,413 --> 00:29:09,582
no evil shall escape my sight.

319
00:29:09,665 --> 00:29:11,667
Let those who
worship evil's might,

320
00:29:11,751 --> 00:29:14,086
beware my power...
Green Lantern's light."

321
00:29:28,768 --> 00:29:30,937
<i>Ring at 100 percent power.</i>

322
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:33,856
Of all the hokey,
lame-ass things...

323
00:30:09,392 --> 00:30:13,062
The Rannian scum have murdered the
Thanagarians sent to destroy them.

324
00:30:13,187 --> 00:30:15,606
Mmm-hmm. You hear
yourself, right?

325
00:30:35,209 --> 00:30:36,209
Move!

326
00:31:06,615 --> 00:31:09,493
Okay, everyone take a moment
and remember our manners.

327
00:31:13,164 --> 00:31:14,165
Aw, crap.

328
00:31:41,484 --> 00:31:43,235
Does everyone here want
to kill each other?

329
00:32:06,175 --> 00:32:08,803
Think! We need to question him.

330
00:32:12,181 --> 00:32:15,518
Of course, interrogation first.

331
00:32:16,477 --> 00:32:18,020
Then, execution.

332
00:32:30,658 --> 00:32:34,120
I don't fear death.
Get on with it.

333
00:32:35,371 --> 00:32:39,291
We had nothing to do with this.
And we don't want to kill you.

334
00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:42,878
Just answer our
questions, please.

335
00:32:44,046 --> 00:32:46,048
This is pointless.

336
00:32:46,132 --> 00:32:48,342
What can he tell us
that is of any value?

337
00:32:48,425 --> 00:32:50,427
Maybe give him a
second to answer?

338
00:32:50,511 --> 00:32:53,013
What was that bright light
that brought you here?

339
00:32:54,974 --> 00:32:57,393
He's a Green Lantern.
Aren't they allies of yours?

340
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:03,816
They were until his people
Killed the Guardians.

341
00:33:05,943 --> 00:33:08,070
The Guardians are dead? How?

342
00:33:08,737 --> 00:33:09,905
First thing's first.

343
00:33:09,989 --> 00:33:10,990
The bright light.

344
00:33:12,992 --> 00:33:14,326
It was a Zeta-Beam.

345
00:33:14,994 --> 00:33:17,913
They seem attracted to
me. I don't know why.

346
00:33:17,997 --> 00:33:19,790
But when they hit,
they transport me

347
00:33:19,874 --> 00:33:22,251
to different, far-reaching
parts of the galaxy.

348
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:24,253
I have little control over them.

349
00:33:25,838 --> 00:33:28,174
Fairy tales and lies
can't undo the fact

350
00:33:28,257 --> 00:33:32,553
that Rann destroyed Oa and
murdered the Green Lanterns.

351
00:33:33,345 --> 00:33:36,348
No. Rann is allied
with the Guardians.

352
00:33:36,432 --> 00:33:39,018
The Green Lanterns are
heroes to the Rannians.

353
00:33:39,101 --> 00:33:41,520
If I can get to High
Command, I'll show you.

354
00:33:43,272 --> 00:33:45,482
The only thing this
man could show us

355
00:33:45,566 --> 00:33:47,693
is the fastest way to
the bottom of a bottle.

356
00:33:48,986 --> 00:33:50,696
I know how I look.

357
00:33:50,779 --> 00:33:52,698
But I'm Adam Strange.

358
00:33:53,991 --> 00:33:56,452
You? You're the Night Flyer?

359
00:33:56,535 --> 00:33:59,788
The Bane of the
Wingmen? Not likely.

360
00:33:59,872 --> 00:34:03,125
Adam Strange is
dead, gone years ago.

361
00:34:03,792 --> 00:34:06,545
Gone, yes. Dead, no.

362
00:34:06,629 --> 00:34:10,132
A Zeta-Beam took me and I couldn't
figure out how to get back.

363
00:34:10,216 --> 00:34:11,800
So, how are you here now?

364
00:34:12,384 --> 00:34:15,721
Random chance. Zeta-Beams
are unpredictable.

365
00:34:16,722 --> 00:34:18,974
As are Rannian cutthroats.

366
00:34:20,392 --> 00:34:21,560
Listen to me.

367
00:34:21,644 --> 00:34:24,063
Rannians would never attack Oa.

368
00:34:25,314 --> 00:34:26,315
Okay, then.

369
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:28,734
Let's go to your High Command
and see if you're right.

370
00:34:31,737 --> 00:34:34,531
Our answers will
be found on Rann.

371
00:34:34,615 --> 00:34:36,909
And so will my vengeance.

372
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:40,621
Great road trip crew
you've assembled, John.

373
00:34:40,704 --> 00:34:41,956
Try not to get murdered.

374
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:01,767
<i>Test complete.</i>

375
00:35:04,353 --> 00:35:06,855
<i>For a Bering that does not
want to be a Green Lantern,</i>

376
00:35:06,939 --> 00:35:08,607
<i>you show some ability.</i>

377
00:35:08,691 --> 00:35:10,526
Just passing the time.

378
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:55,738
What was it that caused the
war between Thanagar and Rann?

379
00:35:55,821 --> 00:35:57,573
Rannian treachery, of course.

380
00:35:57,656 --> 00:36:01,827
Under a guise of a peaceful
experiment meant to benefit everyone,

381
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:05,497
they transported their planet
into our system to conquer it.

382
00:36:05,581 --> 00:36:07,750
What do you mean
Thanagar transported?

383
00:36:07,833 --> 00:36:11,378
You attacked our capital
city first and destroyed it!

384
00:36:11,462 --> 00:36:15,174
That was the war you were
involved in years ago. Many died.

385
00:36:15,257 --> 00:36:18,093
Since you've been gone,
it finally ended in peace.

386
00:36:18,177 --> 00:36:22,639
And as a gesture of hope and
goodwill, we became allies.

387
00:36:22,723 --> 00:36:24,683
Until your leaders tricked us

388
00:36:24,767 --> 00:36:27,269
and tried to destroy
Thanagar for good!

389
00:36:35,361 --> 00:36:37,946
So, we should leave before
either side sees us.

390
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:39,031
Not yet.

391
00:36:44,953 --> 00:36:46,372
It's just a derelict
being yanked

392
00:36:46,538 --> 00:36:48,457
into the gravitational
pull of a red dwarf.

393
00:36:49,208 --> 00:36:51,460
It appears our fighters
did their jobs well.

394
00:36:51,543 --> 00:36:52,544
Can you give it a rest?

395
00:36:52,628 --> 00:36:54,588
I may be able to access
the main computer

396
00:36:54,671 --> 00:36:56,048
with a scan of my DNA.

397
00:37:11,355 --> 00:37:13,732
Oh, yeah, they... they love you.

398
00:37:17,486 --> 00:37:20,656
<i>It seems the deities
have granted me my wish.</i>

399
00:37:22,658 --> 00:37:25,577
To have the pleasure of
killing one more Thanagarian.

400
00:37:27,037 --> 00:37:30,374
Wait! You are Kantus
of House Thrax.

401
00:37:30,457 --> 00:37:32,084
<i>A great and noble captain.</i>

402
00:37:32,835 --> 00:37:36,255
Am I so well known
to Thanagarian spies?

403
00:37:37,923 --> 00:37:40,008
It's me, Adam Strange.

404
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:42,803
He's dead.

405
00:37:43,303 --> 00:37:45,347
Scan me and see the truth.

406
00:37:57,609 --> 00:37:59,778
We thought you died years ago.

407
00:38:00,612 --> 00:38:03,157
I've been away. Now I'm back.

408
00:38:03,949 --> 00:38:07,202
Then, the Thanagarian
is your prisoner?

409
00:38:07,286 --> 00:38:09,538
Prisoner? You Rannian...

410
00:38:09,621 --> 00:38:13,125
She's helping solve a mystery that
affects both Rann and Thanagar.

411
00:38:13,208 --> 00:38:17,171
But we need your help. Can we
tap into your ship's computers?

412
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,303
<i>I've disengaged the firewalls.</i>

413
00:38:24,386 --> 00:38:26,513
<i>You're free to
scan our data bank.</i>

414
00:38:27,264 --> 00:38:31,393
Ring, download all relevant
information on the Rann-Thanagar war.

415
00:38:35,063 --> 00:38:37,816
I'd especially like to
know why Rann attacked Oa.

416
00:38:39,151 --> 00:38:42,237
What? Rann didn't attack Oa!

417
00:38:42,321 --> 00:38:45,282
You lie! We have evidence!

418
00:38:45,365 --> 00:38:48,160
<i>It's too late for
all your accusations.</i>

419
00:38:49,244 --> 00:38:53,499
<i>Soon all your kind will
be wiped out of existence.</i>

420
00:38:55,292 --> 00:38:56,877
What are you talking about?

421
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:02,549
<i>Our greatest scientist is building
a weapon that will destroy Thanagar</i>

422
00:39:02,633 --> 00:39:05,511
<i>and end this war
once and for all.</i>

423
00:39:05,594 --> 00:39:08,013
Sardath. Where?

424
00:39:09,932 --> 00:39:12,017
Only a few key people know.

425
00:39:13,227 --> 00:39:15,103
I'm not one of them.

426
00:39:18,232 --> 00:39:20,192
This ship is doomed.

427
00:39:21,443 --> 00:39:25,948
As captain, I intend
to die with her.

428
00:39:26,031 --> 00:39:29,785
Ring, can you do anything to get
the battle cruiser moving again?

429
00:39:29,868 --> 00:39:32,871
<i>Rerouting power to the
kevval engines is possible.</i>

430
00:39:32,955 --> 00:39:36,500
<i>It may be enough to defeat the
gravitational pull of the red dwarf.</i>

431
00:39:36,583 --> 00:39:39,461
<i>Provided the hull survives
the forces required.</i>

432
00:39:39,962 --> 00:39:41,463
Re-route all power.

433
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:43,549
Whatever you have to do.

434
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:46,051
Do it!

435
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:22,921
<i>Rannian battle cruiser has escaped
the red dwarf's gravitational pull.</i>

436
00:40:23,005 --> 00:40:24,923
Now he can limp his way home.

437
00:40:25,007 --> 00:40:26,341
<i>I don't believe so.</i>

438
00:40:27,426 --> 00:40:29,303
<i>Thank you Adam Strange.</i>

439
00:40:30,929 --> 00:40:32,764
<i>Onward for Rann!</i>

440
00:40:45,944 --> 00:40:47,529
He's going back to the battle!

441
00:40:48,363 --> 00:40:49,364
Idiot.

442
00:40:49,448 --> 00:40:52,534
His ship is useless.
What can he hope to do?

443
00:41:12,846 --> 00:41:16,391
A noble death in battle.
For everyone involved.

444
00:41:18,602 --> 00:41:19,936
Let's get out of here.

445
00:41:35,035 --> 00:41:37,496
Come over here.
We've made progress.

446
00:41:37,579 --> 00:41:41,416
Are you two actually in a room together
without tearing at each other's throats?

447
00:41:42,918 --> 00:41:45,170
Wow. Okay. Yes. Okay. All right.

448
00:41:45,921 --> 00:41:47,464
What have you found out?

449
00:41:47,547 --> 00:41:51,343
When the Zeta-Beam transported
Thanagar into Rann's atmosphere,

450
00:41:51,426 --> 00:41:53,720
it caused catastrophic
climate disasters.

451
00:42:04,815 --> 00:42:06,274
<i>The planet survived.</i>

452
00:42:06,358 --> 00:42:08,360
<i>And that's what started the war.</i>

453
00:42:11,363 --> 00:42:13,907
Now Sardath has
re-engineered the Zeta-Beam

454
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:16,118
into a weapon of
total destruction.

455
00:42:17,744 --> 00:42:19,287
A planet destroyer.

456
00:42:21,123 --> 00:42:22,374
We've got to stop him.

457
00:42:22,457 --> 00:42:23,875
Any idea where they're based?

458
00:42:25,127 --> 00:42:26,545
Unfortunately, no.

459
00:42:26,628 --> 00:42:28,130
But we do have a lead.

460
00:42:28,213 --> 00:42:31,216
We were examining the
data on the attack on Oa.

461
00:42:31,299 --> 00:42:32,718
We discovered this.

462
00:42:44,521 --> 00:42:46,148
It's a Rannian ship.

463
00:42:46,231 --> 00:42:47,649
You were right.

464
00:42:47,733 --> 00:42:48,984
So I thought.

465
00:42:49,067 --> 00:42:52,863
But when we examined the drive
signature it left behind,

466
00:42:52,946 --> 00:42:54,740
something unusual turned up.

467
00:42:54,823 --> 00:42:57,617
We found an exact match.

468
00:42:59,828 --> 00:43:02,038
It was identical to
a ship that bombarded

469
00:43:02,122 --> 00:43:05,041
the United Galactic Council
Headquarters years ago,

470
00:43:05,125 --> 00:43:08,837
sabotaging the first peace talks
and killing several hundred people.

471
00:43:09,755 --> 00:43:12,090
But that was a Thanagarian ship.

472
00:43:12,174 --> 00:43:14,551
And that same ship's
signature was also found

473
00:43:14,634 --> 00:43:17,262
at the scene of many
more unwarranted attacks.

474
00:43:18,513 --> 00:43:21,933
Somebody is impersonating
both Rannians and Thanagarians

475
00:43:22,017 --> 00:43:23,560
to cause your war.

476
00:43:23,643 --> 00:43:25,270
It would seem so.

477
00:43:26,271 --> 00:43:29,316
Strange and I calculated the
direction the drive signatures left

478
00:43:29,399 --> 00:43:30,776
after many such attacks.

479
00:43:30,859 --> 00:43:34,029
In each case, the ship
headed in this direction.

480
00:43:35,405 --> 00:43:37,449
And if we triangulate
the escape routes,

481
00:43:37,532 --> 00:43:41,119
they all meet here,
in this sector.

482
00:43:41,870 --> 00:43:44,790
If we want answers, this
is where we find them.

483
00:43:58,428 --> 00:44:00,388
Maybe your calculations
were wrong?

484
00:44:00,472 --> 00:44:01,681
There's nothing here.

485
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:15,779
Spoke too soon!

486
00:44:42,264 --> 00:44:43,682
I'm on the weapons!

487
00:44:51,022 --> 00:44:52,274
Nice shooting.

488
00:44:52,357 --> 00:44:55,861
Those guns are here to
protect something or somebody.

489
00:44:58,864 --> 00:45:00,448
Bingo. A shielded structure.

490
00:45:01,116 --> 00:45:02,367
I can't see what's inside.

491
00:45:03,285 --> 00:45:05,412
There's only one
way to find out.

492
00:45:31,146 --> 00:45:33,148
Artificial gravity and oxygen.

493
00:45:33,732 --> 00:45:35,817
Somebody went to
a lot of trouble

494
00:45:35,901 --> 00:45:38,320
to build a hideout
in this asteroid.

495
00:45:38,403 --> 00:45:42,574
Well, since they made it so
hospitable, let's go pay them a visit.

496
00:46:30,705 --> 00:46:33,959
What was that you were saying
about this place being hospitable?

497
00:48:11,181 --> 00:48:12,682
Do it! Kill him!

498
00:48:17,645 --> 00:48:18,645
No.

499
00:48:20,315 --> 00:48:21,733
I've had enough killing.

500
00:48:24,402 --> 00:48:27,238
How odd. When it
comes to killing,

501
00:48:27,322 --> 00:48:28,990
I can't get enough of it!

502
00:48:30,075 --> 00:48:31,117
Drop your weapons

503
00:48:31,201 --> 00:48:33,828
or this Green Lantern
becomes green slime.

504
00:48:40,668 --> 00:48:42,253
While we're on the subject.

505
00:48:46,091 --> 00:48:47,842
I think I'll
relieve you of this.

506
00:48:52,013 --> 00:48:53,807
With your lack of experience,

507
00:48:53,890 --> 00:48:56,851
you give new meaning to
the name "Green" Lantern.

508
00:48:58,353 --> 00:48:59,354
Lights out.

509
00:49:36,391 --> 00:49:37,391
John!

510
00:49:37,433 --> 00:49:39,894
I wouldn't try that again.

511
00:49:40,645 --> 00:49:43,481
Next time, you'll be
reduced to a pile of ash.

512
00:49:44,482 --> 00:49:45,942
You look familiar.

513
00:49:46,025 --> 00:49:47,569
His name is Sinestro.

514
00:49:47,652 --> 00:49:50,238
He's a Green Lantern
who went rogue.

515
00:49:51,990 --> 00:49:55,994
If by "went rogue" you mean I
saw through the Guardian's lies,

516
00:49:56,077 --> 00:50:01,583
then yes, I've embraced the power
of yellow energy and gone rogue.

517
00:50:02,333 --> 00:50:05,253
The color yellow is the one thing
your ring power is useless against.

518
00:50:05,336 --> 00:50:07,338
Yeah, the ring told me.

519
00:50:07,422 --> 00:50:11,176
But I've been up against that
kind of barrier my whole life.

520
00:50:12,177 --> 00:50:14,262
It hasn't stopped me yet.

521
00:50:14,345 --> 00:50:16,389
Why don't you just kill us?

522
00:50:17,682 --> 00:50:19,934
Because I may have
a use for you.

523
00:50:20,935 --> 00:50:24,772
But don't worry, your
death is a viable option.

524
00:50:26,691 --> 00:50:27,942
We could dig our way out.

525
00:50:28,026 --> 00:50:29,611
Good thing I've
got a head start.

526
00:50:34,949 --> 00:50:35,950
Hal!

527
00:50:37,285 --> 00:50:39,454
I knew you were alive!
You're too stubborn to die!

528
00:50:39,537 --> 00:50:41,789
You're a sight for
sore eyes, Ollie.

529
00:50:41,873 --> 00:50:42,957
What are you doing here?

530
00:50:43,041 --> 00:50:45,710
We came looking for you after
your ring turned up on his finger.

531
00:50:45,793 --> 00:50:47,503
His name's John Stewart.

532
00:50:50,715 --> 00:50:53,927
And this is Shayera
and Adam Strange.

533
00:50:54,385 --> 00:50:55,887
The Rannian hero?

534
00:50:55,970 --> 00:50:58,389
I wish we were meeting
under better circumstances.

535
00:50:58,848 --> 00:51:00,058
So do I.

536
00:51:00,683 --> 00:51:03,519
Apparently, your ring was
given to John by a Guardian.

537
00:51:04,062 --> 00:51:06,231
So... you received my ring.

538
00:51:07,023 --> 00:51:07,941
From what I heard,

539
00:51:08,024 --> 00:51:11,486
they screwed up big-time by
choosing me as your replacement.

540
00:51:12,153 --> 00:51:14,072
Oh, the Guardians
don't make mistakes

541
00:51:14,155 --> 00:51:15,875
when it comes to
appointing a Green Lantern.

542
00:51:16,908 --> 00:51:18,576
They've been doing it
for a million years.

543
00:51:19,244 --> 00:51:20,995
They won't be doing it anymore.

544
00:51:22,247 --> 00:51:23,665
Oa has been destroyed.

545
00:51:24,582 --> 00:51:26,251
The Guardians are dead.

546
00:51:31,756 --> 00:51:32,799
Sinestro.

547
00:51:34,259 --> 00:51:38,596
We think he disguised his ship as
a Rannian vessel and attacked them.

548
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:40,598
He's done even worse.

549
00:51:41,391 --> 00:51:43,685
He sabotaged Sardath's
grand experiment.

550
00:51:45,186 --> 00:51:46,688
So he started the war?

551
00:51:48,147 --> 00:51:49,524
Why would he do that?

552
00:51:50,358 --> 00:51:51,609
Because he's insane!

553
00:51:52,777 --> 00:51:55,196
Sinestro thrives
on chaos and death.

554
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:57,949
Sure, I get that. But
how did you end up here?

555
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:01,536
And how did your
ring end up with me?

556
00:52:02,203 --> 00:52:05,123
I was told rings only leave
Lanterns after they die.

557
00:52:06,708 --> 00:52:07,875
Good questions.

558
00:52:07,959 --> 00:52:11,129
I'll give you the quick
and dirty explanation...

559
00:52:12,130 --> 00:52:14,632
<i>I was asked to keep watch
on Sardath's experiment.</i>

560
00:52:14,716 --> 00:52:17,010
<i>And while I was outside
with the science barge...</i>

561
00:52:17,802 --> 00:52:20,722
<i>Sinestro infiltrated the base.</i>

562
00:52:24,934 --> 00:52:26,978
<i>The experiment went
out of control.</i>

563
00:52:29,814 --> 00:52:32,817
<i>I was pulled onto the planet before
it teleported with everyone else.</i>

564
00:52:45,163 --> 00:52:46,414
<i>Before I passed out,</i>

565
00:52:46,497 --> 00:52:49,083
<i>I released my ring so
Sinestro couldn't get it.</i>

566
00:52:58,843 --> 00:52:59,844
<i>When I came to...</i>

567
00:53:00,928 --> 00:53:04,182
I was here. And I've
been here ever since.

568
00:53:05,350 --> 00:53:06,851
As for my ring...

569
00:53:06,934 --> 00:53:09,479
Well, It must have been found
by the Guardians and they,

570
00:53:09,562 --> 00:53:10,813
in their wisdom,

571
00:53:10,897 --> 00:53:13,107
chose to reassign it
to a worthy candidate.

572
00:53:14,275 --> 00:53:16,277
I'll be happy to
give it back to you.

573
00:53:16,361 --> 00:53:18,529
If I ever get it back, that is.

574
00:53:20,531 --> 00:53:21,783
We've gotta escape.

575
00:53:22,825 --> 00:53:25,119
Right. To stop Sinestro.

576
00:53:25,203 --> 00:53:27,789
Odd as this is, Sinestro
is problem number two.

577
00:53:27,872 --> 00:53:29,707
First we've got to get to Rann

578
00:53:29,791 --> 00:53:33,044
and stop Sardath from using his new
Doomsday Weapon to destroy Thanagar.

579
00:53:34,212 --> 00:53:35,421
Doomsday Weapon?

580
00:53:36,214 --> 00:53:39,300
Sardath is going to use
Zeta-Beams as a mega-weapon.

581
00:53:39,384 --> 00:53:41,719
He's trying it out
in a secret location.

582
00:53:41,803 --> 00:53:43,888
Only the Rannian High
Command knows where.

583
00:53:45,056 --> 00:53:46,057
Really...

584
00:53:49,644 --> 00:53:52,146
Thank you for all
that information.

585
00:53:52,230 --> 00:53:54,816
See? You were useful after all.

586
00:53:55,733 --> 00:53:57,819
You should be proud.

587
00:53:58,319 --> 00:53:59,987
You'll never get
your hands on it.

588
00:54:00,071 --> 00:54:02,907
No matter how much of an
assault you launch on Rann.

589
00:54:02,990 --> 00:54:04,492
Their defenses are too good.

590
00:54:04,575 --> 00:54:05,868
An assault on Rann

591
00:54:05,952 --> 00:54:08,162
to find the location of
their Doomsday Weapon?

592
00:54:09,997 --> 00:54:11,582
What a splendid idea!

593
00:54:11,666 --> 00:54:13,501
I'll get on that right away!

594
00:54:19,006 --> 00:54:21,509
We really suck at
being covert operators.

595
00:54:21,592 --> 00:54:24,512
Jordan, you said you were
on the verge of escaping.

596
00:54:24,595 --> 00:54:25,596
How?

597
00:54:27,014 --> 00:54:28,182
I've been digging.

598
00:54:28,266 --> 00:54:30,351
Judging from the warmer
temperature of the rock,

599
00:54:30,435 --> 00:54:32,478
I think the controls
for the force field door

600
00:54:32,562 --> 00:54:34,856
are powered by conduits
running through here.

601
00:54:34,939 --> 00:54:36,441
If I can just get to them...

602
00:54:36,524 --> 00:54:39,777
We turn off the force field by
short-circuiting its power feed!

603
00:54:40,361 --> 00:54:41,362
I'm almost there.

604
00:54:41,446 --> 00:54:43,531
But it's another foot of
rock to grind through.

605
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:47,452
Would an Nth metal knife help?

606
00:54:50,163 --> 00:54:52,290
The hardest substance
in the universe?

607
00:54:52,373 --> 00:54:54,542
Yeah, might come in handy.

608
00:55:21,152 --> 00:55:23,821
Lord Damyn, Lyssa,
ready the ship at once.

609
00:55:24,572 --> 00:55:26,574
Dress it as a
Thanagarian cruiser.

610
00:55:27,533 --> 00:55:29,827
They're working
on it as we speak.

611
00:55:30,745 --> 00:55:34,332
Excellent. Rann will
never expect an attack.

612
00:55:35,458 --> 00:55:38,503
The element of surprise should
yield a fruitful result.

613
00:56:11,619 --> 00:56:13,204
He has my mace.

614
00:56:13,287 --> 00:56:15,456
How rude. Allow me.

615
00:56:42,817 --> 00:56:43,818
He's dead.

616
00:56:44,735 --> 00:56:45,820
Serves him right.

617
00:56:46,737 --> 00:56:48,906
I've never known you to
be indifferent to death.

618
00:56:50,241 --> 00:56:53,578
Yeah well, months of being brutalized
in captivity will do that to a man.

619
00:56:56,998 --> 00:56:58,833
And millions of
lives are at stake.

620
00:57:00,126 --> 00:57:02,326
Let's get out of here before
the others leave that ship.

621
00:57:09,343 --> 00:57:10,428
I'll fire up the engines.

622
00:57:10,511 --> 00:57:11,345
Wait.

623
00:57:11,429 --> 00:57:13,931
We need to get the ring.
The Green Lantern ring.

624
00:57:14,473 --> 00:57:15,534
What? Come on. All you've done

625
00:57:15,558 --> 00:57:17,310
is complain about it
and now you want it?

626
00:57:17,893 --> 00:57:20,521
Between Hal and me, one
of us should have it.

627
00:57:20,605 --> 00:57:23,357
We're going into battle.
We might need it.

628
00:57:24,442 --> 00:57:26,003
We don't have time to
go back and get it.

629
00:57:26,027 --> 00:57:27,028
Not necessary.

630
00:57:27,111 --> 00:57:29,697
All John has to do
is will it to come.

631
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:31,616
It doesn't matter
where the ring is.

632
00:57:32,867 --> 00:57:34,702
It'll find a way to get to him.

633
00:57:34,785 --> 00:57:37,288
Close your eyes
and will it back.

634
00:57:37,371 --> 00:57:38,831
But it's your ring.

635
00:57:38,914 --> 00:57:40,207
Not anymore.

636
00:57:40,291 --> 00:57:41,709
It answers to you now.

637
00:57:42,418 --> 00:57:44,295
Close your eyes. Summon it!

638
00:57:44,378 --> 00:57:47,381
Yeah, and Sinestro probably put
it with all of our other weapons.

639
00:57:47,465 --> 00:57:49,467
See if you can
grab those up, too!

640
00:58:33,761 --> 00:58:35,846
What? No! The ring!

641
00:58:36,430 --> 00:58:37,515
Get it! Get it!

642
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:55,240
What?

643
00:58:56,367 --> 00:58:59,120
Ring, do we have enough fuel
to make a jump to warp speed?

644
00:59:00,371 --> 00:59:01,455
<i>Inconclusive.</i>

645
00:59:02,289 --> 00:59:04,709
That's wonderful.
Strap in, everybody.

646
00:59:12,550 --> 00:59:15,177
This ship needs several
months in space dock.

647
00:59:15,261 --> 00:59:18,639
Hull integrity diminishing.
Breach in five seconds.

648
00:59:18,723 --> 00:59:20,683
I'm dropping us
out of warp speed.

649
00:59:24,061 --> 00:59:25,813
We still have a long way to go.

650
00:59:25,896 --> 00:59:28,232
Well, I'll drive as fast as
I can without the hyperdrive.

651
00:59:39,410 --> 00:59:42,663
Sinestro beat us to
Rann! What do we do now?

652
00:59:46,167 --> 00:59:49,170
<i>Adam Strange calling
Rannian High Command.</i>

653
00:59:49,253 --> 00:59:50,755
Is this some kind of trick?

654
00:59:50,838 --> 00:59:52,339
Commander Strange
is no longer...

655
00:59:52,423 --> 00:59:55,426
<i>Jorson? Is that you? It's Adam.</i>

656
00:59:55,509 --> 00:59:57,762
<i>Are you still
terrible at Jaccarat?</i>

657
01:00:02,933 --> 01:00:05,269
By her Lady's Grace, it is you!

658
01:00:06,270 --> 01:00:08,522
Open a window in the shield
for us to get through.

659
01:00:08,606 --> 01:00:10,483
I'll explain everything
when I see you.

660
01:00:10,566 --> 01:00:12,193
<i>Sending you coordinates now.</i>

661
01:00:12,276 --> 01:00:14,278
<i>The window will open
for two seconds.</i>

662
01:00:15,112 --> 01:00:16,405
That's all we need.

663
01:00:29,502 --> 01:00:30,878
Annihilate them.

664
01:00:42,223 --> 01:00:43,808
We've got company.

665
01:01:07,581 --> 01:01:10,376
Hmm. As I live and breathe.

666
01:01:10,459 --> 01:01:12,753
I never thought I'd
lay eyes on you again.

667
01:01:12,837 --> 01:01:14,171
It's good to be back.

668
01:01:15,631 --> 01:01:19,093
I'm sorry the circumstances of
your homecoming are so grim.

669
01:01:19,176 --> 01:01:22,847
I have no idea why these Thanagarians
have launched this futile attack.

670
01:01:22,930 --> 01:01:24,348
They're not Thanagarians.

671
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:29,353
What nonsense is your
prisoner speaking?

672
01:01:29,436 --> 01:01:31,605
I am not a prisoner!

673
01:01:32,189 --> 01:01:34,191
She's not and she's right.

674
01:01:34,275 --> 01:01:36,777
We've uncovered a plot
by a band of rogue agents

675
01:01:36,861 --> 01:01:39,697
to start and keep this war
going between our worlds.

676
01:01:39,780 --> 01:01:41,866
They're the ones
firing on you now!

677
01:01:41,949 --> 01:01:45,202
That ship is not
Thanagarian. It's disguised.

678
01:01:45,286 --> 01:01:46,871
We never thought to check.

679
01:01:46,954 --> 01:01:48,998
But if what you say is true...

680
01:01:49,081 --> 01:01:51,125
We know about the secret weapon.

681
01:01:51,208 --> 01:01:54,378
We have to stop Sardath
from using it on Thanagar.

682
01:01:54,461 --> 01:01:56,630
And I need your
help to contact him.

683
01:01:58,716 --> 01:02:01,385
Adam? Is it really you!?

684
01:02:02,052 --> 01:02:04,388
<i>Yes. I have to see you at once.</i>

685
01:02:04,471 --> 01:02:06,140
<i>Don't deploy your weapon.</i>

686
01:02:06,223 --> 01:02:07,308
How do you know about...

687
01:02:07,391 --> 01:02:09,059
<i>Billions of innocent
lives are art stake.</i>

688
01:02:09,143 --> 01:02:10,895
<i>It can't be used!</i>

689
01:02:11,562 --> 01:02:13,105
But my weapon is the only thing

690
01:02:13,188 --> 01:02:16,483
that will stop the Thanagarians
from killing more of us.

691
01:02:16,567 --> 01:02:19,570
And I have you to
thank for its creation.

692
01:02:20,154 --> 01:02:21,071
<i>Me?</i>

693
01:02:21,155 --> 01:02:23,908
It was the analysis
of your unique biology

694
01:02:23,991 --> 01:02:26,827
that made it possible to
isolate your metagene.

695
01:02:26,911 --> 01:02:27,912
<i>Metagene?</i>

696
01:02:28,579 --> 01:02:31,749
I knew Zeta energy
always found you,

697
01:02:31,832 --> 01:02:33,500
as though drawn to you.

698
01:02:33,584 --> 01:02:37,171
I noticed that you were
born with a unique metagene

699
01:02:37,254 --> 01:02:39,423
and that was my
first breakthrough.

700
01:02:40,758 --> 01:02:44,428
<i>I gained some control over
where the Zeta-Beams went.</i>

701
01:02:48,098 --> 01:02:52,144
<i>Eventually, I was able to
amplify the phenomenon.</i>

702
01:02:58,609 --> 01:03:03,280
<i>Now, I command vast amounts
of Zeta energy at will!</i>

703
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:08,953
<i>We've begun building
a charge large enough</i>

704
01:03:09,036 --> 01:03:11,705
<i>to teleport Thanagar
into a supernova!</i>

705
01:03:14,291 --> 01:03:16,210
Rann will be forever safe!

706
01:03:17,044 --> 01:03:18,796
<i>I beg you not to use it.</i>

707
01:03:18,879 --> 01:03:20,714
<i>You'll be murdering innocents.</i>

708
01:03:20,798 --> 01:03:23,801
I'm shocked to hear
such cowardice from you,

709
01:03:23,884 --> 01:03:26,595
especially since
Thanagar was responsible

710
01:03:26,679 --> 01:03:30,307
for the death of your wife,
my beloved daughter, Alanna.

711
01:03:31,308 --> 01:03:32,726
<i>If Alanna were alive,</i>

712
01:03:32,810 --> 01:03:34,061
<i>she'd be ashamed to learn</i>

713
01:03:34,144 --> 01:03:36,814
<i>that instead of trying to
find our daughter Aleea,</i>

714
01:03:36,897 --> 01:03:40,401
<i>you've been using your time
figuring out how to kill billions!</i>

715
01:03:40,484 --> 01:03:41,568
How dare you!?

716
01:03:42,361 --> 01:03:45,489
<i>Thanagar nor Rann started
this war and I can prove it.</i>

717
01:03:45,572 --> 01:03:49,076
<i>But I'll have to see you face-to-face
to show you the evidence.</i>

718
01:03:49,159 --> 01:03:50,828
I can't do that.

719
01:03:50,911 --> 01:03:54,331
My location is a secret of
the greatest importance,

720
01:03:54,415 --> 01:03:58,752
too sensitive to transmit,
even over a secure line.

721
01:03:58,836 --> 01:04:02,506
But I can use a Zeta-Beam
to transport you here.

722
01:04:05,509 --> 01:04:07,678
<i>Fine. There are five of us.</i>

723
01:04:28,032 --> 01:04:30,534
Don't like that
transporter stuff one bit.

724
01:04:33,454 --> 01:04:35,664
Sardath, in memory of Alanna,

725
01:04:35,748 --> 01:04:39,209
I'm here to prevent you from
making a terrible mistake.

726
01:04:39,293 --> 01:04:41,837
Your first Zeta
experiment was sabotaged.

727
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:43,547
It caused this war!

728
01:04:46,133 --> 01:04:47,634
What are you talking about?

729
01:04:53,182 --> 01:04:55,726
<i>We're being approached by
a Thanagarian attack ship!</i>

730
01:05:01,565 --> 01:05:03,901
Sinestro! How did
he follow us here?

731
01:05:03,984 --> 01:05:05,736
Doesn't matter. Get
ready for a fight.

732
01:07:19,286 --> 01:07:20,370
Hal!?

733
01:07:26,210 --> 01:07:27,794
No time to be soft, pal.

734
01:08:09,419 --> 01:08:11,838
Now I'll have the sheer delight

735
01:08:11,922 --> 01:08:15,092
of destroying the last
of the Green Lanterns.

736
01:08:58,385 --> 01:08:59,636
Damn you.

737
01:09:00,637 --> 01:09:02,472
You gave me no choice.

738
01:09:04,141 --> 01:09:08,729
My master will kill you all!

739
01:09:48,769 --> 01:09:50,354
Shot from behind.

740
01:10:58,922 --> 01:10:59,840
Come on!

741
01:10:59,923 --> 01:11:02,259
We've got to get to Sardath
before he uses the Weapon.

742
01:11:10,642 --> 01:11:13,437
Good news. Sardath isn't
going to use the weapon.

743
01:11:14,229 --> 01:11:15,856
He's handing over the CPU

744
01:11:15,939 --> 01:11:18,942
containing the core of
his Zeta technology to me.

745
01:11:19,025 --> 01:11:21,778
The code is downloading
to this storage unit.

746
01:11:23,029 --> 01:11:27,534
The only other place where this
knowledge is stored is my mind.

747
01:11:28,285 --> 01:11:29,536
Excellent.

748
01:11:32,456 --> 01:11:34,958
Hal! What have you done?

749
01:11:38,378 --> 01:11:39,963
What was necessary!

750
01:11:41,381 --> 01:11:44,134
But there's still a
lot of work to be done.

751
01:11:59,816 --> 01:12:02,569
Oh, you'll have to
do better than that.

752
01:12:04,571 --> 01:12:06,406
Hal, what's wrong with you?

753
01:12:07,407 --> 01:12:10,410
We had it all backwards. He
wasn't Sinestro's prisoner.

754
01:12:10,494 --> 01:12:12,412
Hal was his master!

755
01:12:13,622 --> 01:12:16,333
Right you are,
John. Right you are.

756
01:12:16,416 --> 01:12:19,002
I have him to thank
for my transformation.

757
01:12:20,754 --> 01:12:25,091
He was the stepping stone so I
could fulfill my true calling...

758
01:12:30,138 --> 01:12:31,515
with these!

759
01:12:53,411 --> 01:12:55,539
<i>After the experiment
went haywire,</i>

760
01:12:55,622 --> 01:12:58,416
<i>Sinestro infected me
with an alien parasite.</i>

761
01:13:00,293 --> 01:13:02,796
<i>He called it the
Parallax entity!</i>

762
01:13:08,885 --> 01:13:10,679
<i>He thought it would
bend me to his will.</i>

763
01:13:20,564 --> 01:13:23,608
<i>But instead, it opened my eyes.</i>

764
01:13:27,821 --> 01:13:30,073
<i>It filled me with new purpose.</i>

765
01:13:30,156 --> 01:13:31,825
<i>For too long, I had been blind</i>

766
01:13:31,908 --> 01:13:35,495
<i>to the corrosive effect
of war and conflict.</i>

767
01:14:00,020 --> 01:14:03,773
<i>I saw clearly that I was the
one destined to change it!</i>

768
01:14:04,774 --> 01:14:07,777
<i>I could be a better
Guardian than the Guardians.</i>

769
01:14:10,030 --> 01:14:11,698
<i>There was no use
for them anymore.</i>

770
01:14:20,957 --> 01:14:23,752
<i>After Sinestro saw
my truth and genius,</i>

771
01:14:23,835 --> 01:14:26,129
<i>he became my main acolyte.</i>

772
01:14:43,313 --> 01:14:47,233
With this weapon, I can
fulfill my true purpose.

773
01:14:47,317 --> 01:14:51,821
I can wipe the universe clean
and create a newer, better one...

774
01:14:51,905 --> 01:14:53,573
Like a God!

775
01:15:46,626 --> 01:15:48,837
Go. We'll be fine.

776
01:16:18,241 --> 01:16:22,078
I've set the Zeta-Beam to
destroy both Rann and Thanagar.

777
01:16:23,997 --> 01:16:29,002
Make the choice and join me in
making a new and better galaxy.

778
01:16:30,670 --> 01:16:33,840
My only choice is to
stop you or die trying.

779
01:16:56,070 --> 01:16:59,282
Hal! This isn't you!

780
01:17:01,868 --> 01:17:03,036
You're right.

781
01:17:03,119 --> 01:17:06,080
The old me would continue a
useless fight against evil

782
01:17:06,164 --> 01:17:07,373
as a Green Lantern.

783
01:17:10,543 --> 01:17:13,171
But the new me is a god.

784
01:17:17,383 --> 01:17:19,302
And I thought you
were my friend.

785
01:17:20,386 --> 01:17:21,971
I am your friend, Hal.

786
01:17:22,055 --> 01:17:24,557
Just listen to me and
stop this madness!

787
01:17:33,191 --> 01:17:34,692
Try to stop the Zeta-Beam!

788
01:17:40,740 --> 01:17:41,908
Why fight me?

789
01:17:41,991 --> 01:17:45,495
Aren't I doing exactly what
you'd do if you were in my place?

790
01:17:45,578 --> 01:17:47,914
I can see it in your eyes.

791
01:17:47,997 --> 01:17:51,167
You hate what the universe
has become as much as I do.

792
01:17:52,919 --> 01:17:54,629
No, you're wrong.

793
01:18:28,955 --> 01:18:32,375
It's locked. We'll never
get through on time.

794
01:18:33,376 --> 01:18:35,044
Maybe John could use his ring.

795
01:18:35,712 --> 01:18:39,799
No. It would take a billion rings
to put a dent in the Zeta force.

796
01:18:39,883 --> 01:18:41,217
It can't be stopped.

797
01:18:42,051 --> 01:18:43,970
But maybe it can be re-directed.

798
01:18:44,053 --> 01:18:45,179
What are you saying?

799
01:18:46,139 --> 01:18:49,809
Shayera, keep an eye on the
Universe for me while I'm gone.

800
01:19:03,489 --> 01:19:05,742
You've made me realize
the Green Lantern oath

801
01:19:05,825 --> 01:19:08,077
isn't just some silly rhyme.

802
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:12,332
It means something after all.

803
01:19:14,042 --> 01:19:15,335
"In brightest day,

804
01:19:18,046 --> 01:19:19,672
in blackest night,

805
01:19:20,423 --> 01:19:23,176
no evil shall escape my sight.

806
01:19:23,676 --> 01:19:25,720
Let those who
worship evil's might

807
01:19:27,055 --> 01:19:28,640
beware my power...

808
01:19:29,933 --> 01:19:31,768
Green Lantern's light."

809
01:19:45,782 --> 01:19:46,908
What's happening?

810
01:19:51,287 --> 01:19:53,623
I've finally
remembered why I fight.

811
01:19:58,044 --> 01:19:59,044
No!

812
01:20:02,048 --> 01:20:06,636
And why, whatever price I
have to pay, I'm okay with it.

813
01:20:15,770 --> 01:20:17,814
Maybe the Guardians
made the right choice

814
01:20:17,897 --> 01:20:19,649
by making me a Green Lantern.

815
01:20:28,324 --> 01:20:30,910
But killing you isn't the way.

816
01:20:30,994 --> 01:20:33,746
John, the beam's locked in.

817
01:20:34,580 --> 01:20:36,499
We've tried everything
we can think of.

818
01:20:36,582 --> 01:20:38,501
But we cannot stop it from here.

819
01:20:46,592 --> 01:20:50,513
John, you're too
soft to be a Lantern.

820
01:21:30,386 --> 01:21:32,388
You're too late.

821
01:21:45,151 --> 01:21:46,151
Look!

822
01:22:03,419 --> 01:22:04,796
For you Alanna.

823
01:22:18,601 --> 01:22:21,687
For a Rannian, he
was very brave.

824
01:22:25,274 --> 01:22:28,111
Thanks for saving my life.

825
01:22:30,404 --> 01:22:32,323
I had to kill my best friend.

826
01:22:34,867 --> 01:22:36,786
I don't know how I'm
supposed to live with that.

827
01:22:38,996 --> 01:22:41,791
We're all forced to do
things we don't want to.

828
01:22:41,874 --> 01:22:44,127
We can't beat
ourselves up over it,

829
01:22:45,378 --> 01:22:47,797
as long as we do them
for the right reasons.

830
01:23:28,504 --> 01:23:30,089
Thanks for the ride, Shayera.

831
01:23:31,424 --> 01:23:33,676
Now, there's just one
more thing left to do.

832
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:36,929
Rebuild the Green Lantern Corps.

833
01:23:51,194 --> 01:23:53,112
I hope to see you
soon, John Stewart.

834
01:23:54,697 --> 01:23:57,533
Thanagar will need a Green
Lantern to help watch over it.

835
01:24:28,564 --> 01:24:30,149
Congratulations, hero.

836
01:24:30,233 --> 01:24:31,734
You're a Green Lantern.

837
01:24:32,401 --> 01:24:33,402
How's it feel?

838
01:24:33,486 --> 01:24:34,487
I'm starving.

839
01:24:35,571 --> 01:24:39,158
Let's get something to eat
and toast our absent friends.

840
01:24:40,326 --> 01:24:41,744
And maybe a few new ones.

840
01:24:42,305 --> 01:25:42,759
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
